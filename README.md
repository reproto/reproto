This is the home of `reproto`, an experimental system for managing JSON schemas.

If you want to take the system for a leasurely spin, please go to <https://reproto.github.io>.

`reproto` is the following things:

* A custom [interface description language] that permits describing the schema of JSON and
  bidirectional rpc services (like [gRPC]).
* A [derive command], capable of deriving schemas directly from JSON.
* A compiler which generates code for [various languages].
* A [semantic version checker] which verifies that modifications to schemas do not violate
  [semantic versioning].
* A build system with a package manager and a `reproto.toml` [build manifest].
* A rich, markdown-based [documentation generator].
* (eventually) A [central repository] of usable schemas.
* [Structural code-generation] instead of template-based.
  This permits reproto to generate idiomatic, well-indented code with sparse imports.
  Similar to what you would write by hand.

These things combined support an ecosystem where schemas can be maintained and shared across
projects.

**Note:** This project is in an early stage. Things will change a lot. Please take it for a spin,
but avoid building large repositories of specifications right now.

## Helping Out

You want to help out? Great!

You might want to start on issues marked with [good first issue].
If you have a support for a programming language that you feel is lacking, please help out with
[language support].

For any of these, just poke the issue with a quick `I want to do this!`.
If mentoring instructions are lacking, they will be made available as soon as possible.

## Getting Started

* See the [documentation] for an overview of how the reproto language and its build manifest works.
* See [examples] for some example specifications.
* See the [integration tests] for even more examples on how protocol specifications can be used.

[documentation]: /doc/
[examples]: /examples
[integration tests]: /it

## Language Support

* Java (`java`)
  * Data models using [jackson] (`jackson`), and/or [lombok] (`lombok`).
  * [gRPC] services through the `grpc` module.
* C# (`csharp`)
  * Data models using [Json.NET] (`Json.NET`).
* Python (`python`)
  * Plain-python classes, compatible with 2 and 3 for binding data efficiently.
* Rust (`rust`)
  * [Serde]-based serialization for data structures.
  * `datetime` support through the [`chrono`] crate.
* JavaScript (`js`)
  * ES2015 classes, that can be transpiled using babel for older targets, see the
    [js integration test].

## Generating Documentation

`reproto` can generate rich markdown-based documentation from your specifications.

Go to <https://reproto.github.io/reproto/doc-examples/> to see what this documentation looks like.

These have been generated from the [examples project] using [tools/update-doc-examples].

[examples project]: /examples/
[tools/update-doc-examples]: /tools/update-doc-examples

## Building and Installing

Make sure you have [gotten started with Rust][rust-get-started].

Initialize submodules:

```bash
$ git submodule update --init
```

Pack syntax highlighting and themes:

```bash
$ make dumps
```

Build and install the CLI.
This will install `reproto` into `~/.cargo/bin`, make sure it is in your PATH:

```bash
$ cargo install --path $PWD/cli reproto
```

[rust-get-started]: https://rustup.rs

## [Maven Plugin]

A Maven plugin that integrates reproto into the build lifecycle of a maven project.

[Maven Plugin]: https://github.com/reproto/reproto-maven-plugin

## [VIM Plugin]

A VIM plugin that provides syntax highlighting.

[VIM Plugin]: https://github.com/reproto/reproto-vim

## Testing

This project includes an extensive set of integration tests.

See `make help` for documentation on what can be done.

Suites are tests which compiled a given set of rules, and compares with expected output.

Projects are complete project tests.
These are projects written for various programming languages, and are generally harder to build.

To run all tests, do:

```bash
$> make clean all
```

## Comparison with other systems

reproto has _plenty_ of overlap with other projects.

This section is not intended as a criticism of other projects, but rather a reflection on how
reproto differs from them.

As a general note, the [semantic versioning/semck][semck] story with reproto is tightly coupled
with dependency management.
Any system that doesn't address versioning and dependency management, can't check for violations in
semantic versioning either.

[semck]: /doc/semck.md

#### OpenAPI (previously: Swagger)

Is primarily [a specification][openapi-spec], leading to inertia to develop further.
reproto aims to be self-contained in a single project that does everything you need.

Suffers from over-specification without sensible defaults, making it more verbose.

[Has a solution for field-based polymorphism](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/data-models/inheritance-and-polymorphism/), very verbose.

Compare:

```yaml
components:
  schemas:
    InterfaceObject:
      oneOf:
        - $ref: '#/components/schemas/SimpleObject'
        - $ref: '#/components/schemas/ComplexObject'
      discriminator:
        propertyName: type
    SimpleObject:
      type: object
      required:
        - type
      properties:
        type:
          type: string
    ComplexObject:
      type: object
      required:
        - type
      properties:
        type:
          type: string
```

With:

```reproto
interface InterfaceObject {
  SimpleObject;
  ComplexObject;
}
```

Doesn't solve dependency management or versioning.

Is based on YAML, which is harder to read.

[openapi-spec]: https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification

#### Protocol Buffers

Is a great system (one of the big inspirations), but interacts poorly with JSON.
JSON is still the de-facto way of interacting with browsers.
This leads to developers targeting the web to steer clear of it.
This in turn severely limits adoption and causes integration pains where protobuf is used in the
backend.

Because of the limiting factors in supporting a c/c++ backend, reproto probably never will.
For protobuf this has colored the protobuf implementation for other platforms, which has lead to it
generating code which exposes an excessive amount of unsafe APIs.
This is unsuitable for exposing through client libraries and frequently leads to an additional
layer of safe wrapping to make it palatable.

Very poor support for field-based polymorphism.

Doesn't solve dependency management or versioning. Google has no motivation to address it due to
their approach with [monorepos][google-monorepos].

**Note:** reproto might one day be taught how to interact with protocol buffers and translate them
to and from JSON.

#### GraphQL

I _really dig_ GraphQL.

Doesn't support field-based polymorphism without extensive hackery.

Doesn't solve dependency management or versioning.

#### JSON Schema

Very poor ecosystem. JSON-based. Doesn't solve dependency management.
