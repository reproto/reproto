# Introduction

Reproto is a system for managing JSON schemas.
It permits a developer to specify the structure of JSON as specifications, that can then be used to
generated language-specific bindings.

This project has a number of goals:

**Implement a schema language that is concise and expressive** &mdash;
The specification of a JSON object should not be too verbose, otherwise it risks becoming a burden
to maintain.

**Be a stable, self-contained system** &mdash;
Everything related to reproto, from the compiler to all tools, is part of the same project.

**Push the envelope** &mdash;
Reproto is fundamentally an experiment intended to push the envelope in how to do schema management
for JSON.
We aim to improve the state-of-the art.

**Correctness before performance** &mdash;
Schemas are worthless if they don't provide guarantees in the structure they describe.
We do our best to guarantee that the generated code follow the specification provided to the
letter.
